<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Hay Mar Lwin. I'm from Myanmar. Mostly, people known me as Hailey.
I'm a final-year BBAHRM student. More like a soon-to-be fresh grad. I'm just waiting for the graduation 
to come. I've done with all the courses, exams and internship. Yeah, pretty much everything is settle now.
So, before graduation, I don't wanna just sit down and waste my potential. Therefore, I extended my 
Internship to one more month; because money talks, you know. Moreover, at the same time, I'm learning this, coding.
There are times I feel depressed and feel like I'm so left behind. But hey! That's life, ain't it? Haha.
Well, thank you for reading till the end. I really hope I could see you in my birthday. This year is important
to me because my birthday and birth date are the same. I'm more excited because of that for this year. Hope to see 
you there! Byeee... 
</p>
